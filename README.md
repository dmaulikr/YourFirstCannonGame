# YourFirstCannonGame

----- ABOUT THIS -----
This is small project created in 2013. It is my first demo project using cocos2d/box2d. The demo is actually
a clone of well known game paper cannon. The purpose of the game is to fire cannonball towards the enemies. When 
these cannonballs explode they must be as close to the target as possible in order to destroy it.
In this project user has a cannon that can rotate. User can also set the velocity of the cannon balls by drawing 
bigger or smaller virtual line towards the targets. There are static and moving obstacles,single and joined.

a small demo of the project can be watched here
